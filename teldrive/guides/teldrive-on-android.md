## Installation

### Installing Termux

Before continuing, ensure that Termux is installed correctly.

### Download Sources

Install Termux **only** from one of the following official sources:

- **F-Droid:** https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/
- **GitHub Releases:** https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases

> [!Important]
> - Do **not** install Termux from the Google Play Store.
> - The Play Store version is outdated and no longer supported.

### Choosing the Correct APK

When installing from GitHub releases, you may see multiple APK variants:

- **`arm64-v8a`** — Recommended for most modern Android devices  
- **`armeabi-v7a`** — For older 32-bit ARM devices  
- **`universal.apk`** — Works on all devices  

> If you are **not sure** which architecture your device uses, install **`universal.apk`**, which works on all devices.

### Initial Termux Setup

After opening Termux for the first time:

1. Allow storage access when prompted.

2. Run the following command in Termux:
   ```bash
   termux-setup-storage
   ```

   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   ```
> Once completed, Termux is ready for use.
